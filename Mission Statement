MISSION STATEMENT
======

Conscious Commuter is a web application that allows intra-city commuters within the city of Toronto to explore how their daily commute can have
a large impact over time. Work-Commuting, the process of driving a vehicle (often containing a single occupant) is a primary contributor to congestion
issues and pollutant release in in major urban centers such as Toronto. 
Often times, the distance of a typical intra-city commute is well within the bike-able range yet this option is frequently ignored as
the detrimental effects of a short work commute are thought of as being insignificant.
This application provides users the opportunity to quantify the cumulative effects of their daily work commute over weekly and annual time scales
It is hoped that quantifying these effects will empower users to investigate alternative methods of commuting.

In doing so, the app provides the opportunity to explore comparative statistics that would be achieved if the same route was undertaken by bike instead of car.
By demonstrating the financial, health and environmental benefits of choosing to bike to work instead of drive. The application hopes to
empower Torontonians to make sustainable commute choices.
