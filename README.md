Using the App
======

**To access the Web app in browser:**
 


**Enter your Commute**
Use the address geocoder in the top right to enter in your commute destination and origin point. For example, your commute will likely start at your residence and end at your place of work. Enter in the addresses of these two locations and hit enter. The app will generate a typical travel route that is used for this commute.


**Input your Commute Details**
Not all commutes are equal, different vehicles, changing gas prices and frequency of the commute all have a signficant impact in the financial and environmental costs associated with work commutes. Enter in some simple details regarding your work commute using the options show in the box at right. 
Choose the vehicle type that is most similar to the vehicle you regularly use during your commute. Gas prices for the day are shown here and are updated in realtime for the city of Toronto.
Next enter the number of times this commute is taken. For example, during a typical 5 day work week, a commute route is taken 10 times in a week (twice per day, including return trips).
 

**View your Commute Report Summary**
Once you have refined you commute details, you are ready to view your commute summary. Hit the button below to be presented with an infographic outlining the estimate gas usage, CO2 release and Fuel/maintanence costs accumulated over a single weeks worth of commuting.
You will also see a column that provides the option to view what a similar commute report would look like if this trip were to be made by bike. There you will be presented with the opportunity to see the addditional health benefits associated with bike commuting by providing estimate caloric burn expected during the trip.
